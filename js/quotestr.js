		<q>Researching, or <b>studying</b>, the Bible is another practical way to abide in the Word. The difference between
			reading and studying the Bible involves two additional activities: asking questions of the text and
			writing down
			your insight. You haven't really studied the Bible unless you've written your thoughts down on paper or
			comupter.</q>

		<q>The best way to become a 'doer of the Word' is to always write out an action step as a result of your
			reading or
			studying or reflecting on God's Word. Develop the habit of writing down exactly what you intend to
			do.</q>

		<q>Many people have a good habit of writing down a dairy. But it's usually a date based, ordered and centered rather than the Word centered. It would soon become meaningless & usesless. Only the biblical centered notes will shine forever.  It is a way to store treasures in Heaven (Mat 6:20). It's a way to show that "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children" (Rom 8:16, NIV).</q>
