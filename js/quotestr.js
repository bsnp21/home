		<q>Researching, or <b>studying</b>, the Bible is another practical way to abide in the Word. The difference between
			reading and studying the Bible involves two additional activities: asking questions of the text and
			writing down
			your insight. You haven't really studied the Bible unless you've written your thoughts down on paper or
			computer.</q>

		<q>The best way to become a 'doer of the Word' is to always write out an action step as a result of your
			reading or
			studying or reflecting on God's Word. Develop the habit of writing down exactly what you intend to
			do.</q>

		<q>Many people have a good habit of dairy writing. But it's usually a date-ordered, time-based, and cultrue-driven rather than the Scripture-oriented. It would soon become meaningless & usesless. Only the biblical-centered sprititual notes can shine forever. It is a way to grow in HIM. It is a way <cite class='bibleverse'>to store treasures in Heaven</cite> <a class='smallnote'>(Mat 6:20)</a>. It's a way to show in the world that <cite class='bibleverse'>'The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God'</cite> <a class='smallnote'>(Rom8:16 ESV)</a> </q>
